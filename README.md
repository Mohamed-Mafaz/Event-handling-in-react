# Event-handling-in-react
This is the demonstration of how to handle event in react.It contains mouse events like onClick,onMouseOver,and onMouseOut.
The output is as follows:
1.When the submit button is clicked the 'Hello' changes to 'Submitted Successfully'.
2.When the mouse pointer is on (or) over the submit button it changes the colour of the submit button from 'white' to 'black'.
3.When the mouse pointer is off (or) moved out of the submit button it changes the colour of the submit button from 'black' to 'white'.
